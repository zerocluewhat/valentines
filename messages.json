You could say 6,736 miles of distance makes the heart grow fonder and now we're so, so close to closing this gap. I can't wait to see you walk into my arms on Tuesday. I'm so, so, so, so excited! You are my safe place, my happiest thought, and the only person I’d ever want to do long-distance for. But I think we both agree that we’re way better in the same timezone, when every morning lines up and a good morning can make my day. Our lives are about to change, a lot. University, months together and so much more. Our future together is on the horizon and I'm happy to say that it's with you. ",
